## Introduction

JSON is a syntax for storing data.

It can be easily parsed by JavaScript, and it is heavily used in databases for this same reason.

The syntax of a JSON object can be summarized as follows:

* Data is organized in key/value pairs.
* Keys are Strings, written inside double quotes ""
* Values can be a String, a number, a JSON Object, an array, a boolean, null.
* Data is separated by commas.
* Curly braces {} store objects
* Square brackets [] store arrays
* The file extension is .json

```json
{ "some": "json" }
```

## Typical mistakes

* Using keys that are not strings
* Using single quotes instead of double quotes.
* Unmatched curly braces or square brackets.
*


## JSON and JavaScript

```javascript
//this returns a JavaScript object
JSON.parse()
```
